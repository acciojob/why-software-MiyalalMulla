	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>TI want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems, building things from scratch, and continuously learning. Technology is shaping the future, and being a developer allows me to be part of that change. I love how coding combines creativity and logic turning an idea into a working application is both challenging and rewarding.
